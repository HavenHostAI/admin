# Test-Driven Development

- Start by writing or updating an automated test that fails because the desired behaviour does not yet exist.
- Run the relevant test command to observe the failure before making implementation changes.
- Implement the minimal code necessary to make the failing test(s) pass.
- Re-run the test suite (or focused tests) to confirm the fix.
- Only then proceed to refactor or extend the code, keeping the test suite green at each step.
- Prefer unit or integration tests that align with the project's existing testing stack (Vitest for unit, Playwright for e2e) unless the user specifies otherwise.
